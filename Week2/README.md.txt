# Week 2 — Regression & Classification

This week covers core supervised ML algorithms with both manual and sklearn implementation.

## ✔ What I Learned
- Linear Regression math (MSE, gradient descent)
- Polynomial Regression
- Decision Trees & Random Forest
- SVM (kernels) & KNN (distance metrics)
- Regression & classification metrics
- End-to-end ML project workflow

## ✔ Daily Breakdown
- **Day 1:** Linear Regression + gradient descent  
- **Day 2:** Decision Trees & Random Forest  
- **Day 3:** SVM + KNN  
- **Day 4:** MAE, RMSE, Confusion matrix, F1, ROC/AUC  
- **Day 5–6:** Project work (classification/regression)  
- **Day 7:** Weekly test

## ✔ Deliverables
- All algorithm notebooks  
- Project notebook (cleaning → training → evaluation)  
- Model comparison results
