# Mini Project #2 – House Price Prediction (California Housing)

This project is part of Week 2 (Regression + Classification).  
It uses the California Housing dataset from sklearn.

### Day 5 Work:
- Loaded dataset from sklearn
- Converted to pandas DataFrame
- Performed EDA (histograms, correlations, scatter plots)
- Checked for duplicates, data types, distributions
- Split data into train and test sets
- Trained baseline Linear Regression model
- Evaluated using MAE, RMSE, R²
- Created residual plots

### Day 6 Work:
- Scaled the dataset
- Trained Random Forest Regressor
- Trained XGBoost Regressor
- Feature importance visualization
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Created model performance comparison table
- Selected best model based on RMSE & R²
