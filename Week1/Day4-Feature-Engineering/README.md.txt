Day 4 – Feature Engineering

Today’s focus: transforming raw data into meaningful features that improve model performance.
We performed binning, scaling, encoding, and outlier handling on the Titanic dataset.

🔹 Topics Covered
1. Binning

Converted continuous values (e.g., Age) into discrete buckets.

Created categories like: Child, Young Adult, Adult, Senior.

2. Scaling

Applied:

MinMaxScaler

StandardScaler

Compared the effect on numerical columns.

3. Encoding

Converted categorical features using:

One-Hot Encoding

Label Encoding

4. Handling Outliers

Detected outliers using:

IQR method

Z-score method (if used)

Capped/replaced outliers for numeric features.
