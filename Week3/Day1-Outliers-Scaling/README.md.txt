# Day 1 — Outliers & Scaling (Week 3)

## ✔ Concepts Covered
- Outlier detection: IQR, Z-score, boxplots
- Outlier handling: removal, capping, log transformation
- Scaling techniques: StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler
- When scaling is required (algorithm-wise)
- Visual comparison of distributions

## ✔ Outputs
- Boxplots and histograms before/after cleaning
- Scaled numerical features
- Comparison of Standard vs MinMax scaling
- Interpretation notes
